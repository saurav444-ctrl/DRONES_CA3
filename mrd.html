        Multi-rotor drones, also known as rotary-wing, are the most widely used type of drones for recreational and professional use. T
        heir small size and excellent control make multi-rotor drones the best choice for aerial photography.</dl>

        Offering great versatility, they allow the installation of all types of cameras to perform different tasks. They are drones that can hover easily and take off vertically, adding more flexibility as well.

        However, the biggest drawback of multi-rotor drones is usually related to the flight autonomy they offer. Adding more rotors makes the drone more difficult to control. All those moving parts also consume extra energy, draining the battery faster. Most multi-rotor drones have a flight time of less than an hour. If we want to perform certain tasks that take a long time, we have to have several batteries
         to replace them. This also means extra costs.

        Fixed-wing drones are those capable of harnessing air and generating forces that allow them to stay in the air by taking advantage of their aerodynamics. They are similar in design or aesthetics to radio-controlled aircraft and are often used to map large areas due to their powerful autonomy. They take advantage of their aerodynamics and design to keep them afloat, which means 
        they have a longer endurance and flight speed.

        The downside of fixed-wing drones is that they tend to be more expensive compared to multi-rotor drones. They require a large, clear space to take off and land, just like airplanes. Some larger models also require specialized ground equipment to help them take off and land. In addition, fixed-wing drones can only fly forward, so they do not offer the
        same maneuverability as multi-rotor drones.

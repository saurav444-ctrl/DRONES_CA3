        Large drones are comparable in size to smaller aircraft and are used mainly for military purposes such
        
        as surveillance and strategy. With the most advanced technology, they are replacing fighter jets, allowing for rapid enemy 
        detection and combat capabilities. They are also designed for civil applications such as drone deliveries or filmmaking.

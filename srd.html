        Powerful and durable, single-rotor drones look similar in construction and design to actual helicopters, with only one rotor to provide power, 
        plus a tail to control direction and stability. Combining the advantages of tiny multi-rotor drones
        and single-rotor drones, they are better suited to carry larger payloads and fly more efficiently than 
        multi-rotors. Single-rotor devices typically use gas engines rather than batteries, which greatly increases their flight time.

        However, these drones tend to be larger and more complex than other types of UAVs.
         This means they are more 
        expensive and more difficult to operate, and their larger blades can make them more dangerous

        Small drones they are slightly larger than micro drones, between 50 cm and 2 meters. The wings of these drones are usually 
        fixed and can be easily lifted by the arm and thrown into the air. They can be used for indoor equipment inspections 
        (prop guards, cages ......),but they are more often used outdoors for recreation and photography, 
        such as traffic management.</dl>

        The size of these drones can be as small as an insect and easily fit in the palm of your hand, 
        with dimensions between 1 and 50 cm. Because of their small size and wing design, nano drones can fly in very confined spaces 
        and are not easily detected and are mainly used by spies to gather information on people and objects.

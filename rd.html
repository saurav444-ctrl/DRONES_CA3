        Competitive drone or FPV racing is generally used on private and strictly regulated land and consists of obstacle courses 
        at high speeds by flying a drone with virtual reality glasses, an activity that requires many hours of training to gain the agility
        and reflexes needed to control the drone. There are now a growing number of clubs that can legally engage in this hobby.
